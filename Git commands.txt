# These commands have to be executed just once
git init
git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>

Notes:
- Take into account that some projects call their principal branch "master" or "main". If you're starting a new project use the convention you like.
- The "|" symbol means "or". It's not part of the git command it just means an alternative you can use. Rember: git commands always start with "git".
